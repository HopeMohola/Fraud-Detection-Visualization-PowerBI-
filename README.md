# 🛡️ Fraud Detection Visualization with Power BI

## 📌 Overview
This project is an in-depth fraud detection analysis using **Power BI**, where we visualize fraudulent transactions and identify key patterns in fraudulent activities. 
By leveraging interactive charts and maps, we gain valuable insights into where and how fraud occurs.

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ **Fraud is Concentrated in Specific Locations**
- Certain cities and regions show a **higher number of fraud cases**, places such as Angouleme followed by Aurellec.
- **Possible Explanation:** These locations may have weak security measures, a higher number of digital transactions, or frequent high-value transactions.

### 2️⃣ **Certain Payment Methods Are More Susceptible to Fraud**
- Transactions via **credit cards** and **online bank transfers** show significantly higher fraud rates.
- **Possible Explanation:** Fraudsters prefer digital transactions as they are easier to manipulate compared to cash payments.

### 3️⃣ **Time-Based Fraud Trends**
- Fraudulent transactions **peak at specific times**, mostly in the month of February where we saw an influx of fraudulent transactions.
- **Possible Explanation:** Fraudsters take advantage of reduced monitoring during these hours.

### 4️⃣ **High-Value Transactions Are Riskier**
- A clear pattern shows that fraud is more common in **high-value transactions**.
- **Possible Explanation:** Fraudsters aim for bigger payouts, making large transactions a prime target.

## 🔎 Possible Conclusions
✅ **Enhanced Monitoring in High-Risk Locations:** Businesses should strengthen fraud detection mechanisms in the most affected areas such as places surrounding Angouleme.  
✅ **Tighter Security for Digital Transactions:** Stronger authentication processes should be implemented for online payments.  
✅ **Fraud Alerts During Peak Hours:** Banks and payment processors should flag and review suspicious late-night transactions.  
✅ **Setting Limits on High-Value Transactions:** Introducing additional verification for large transactions can prevent fraud.
